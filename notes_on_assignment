Admittedly, the last few of this assignment were super tough. I'm a bit behind on assignments so I decided to not complete them in the interset of continuuing the tracks and finishing the other assignments
Good news is I can come back to these later, hopefully with a more robust understanding of the material. Maybe even do it in Python
